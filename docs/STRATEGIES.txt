OPTIONS ANALYZER - STRATEGY GUIDE
==================================

This document explains each strategy the analyzer supports.


================================================================================
CASH SECURED PUT (CSP)
================================================================================

WHAT IT IS:
Sell an out-of-the-money (OTM) put option and hold cash equal to the strike
price x 100 as collateral.

HOW IT WORKS:
- You receive premium immediately when you sell the put
- If the stock stays ABOVE the strike at expiration: you keep the full premium
- If the stock falls BELOW the strike: you must buy 100 shares at the strike

EXAMPLE:
- Stock XYZ is trading at $50
- You sell the $45 put for $0.80 premium
- You set aside $4,500 cash as collateral (45 x 100)
- You receive $80 immediately (0.80 x 100)

OUTCOMES:
- Stock stays above $45: You keep $80, return = $80/$4500 = 1.78%
- Stock falls to $42: You buy 100 shares at $45, cost basis = $44.20

WHEN TO USE:
- Bullish or neutral outlook on the stock
- You'd be happy to own the stock at the strike price
- IV is elevated (you get more premium)

CAPITAL REQUIRED:
Strike price x 100 shares

MAX PROFIT: Premium received
MAX LOSS: Strike price - Premium (if stock goes to $0)
BREAKEVEN: Strike - Premium per share


================================================================================
PUT CREDIT SPREAD (Bull Put Spread)
================================================================================

WHAT IT IS:
Sell an OTM put and simultaneously buy a further OTM put at a lower strike.
The long put limits your risk.

HOW IT WORKS:
- Sell the higher strike put (receive premium)
- Buy the lower strike put (pay premium)
- Net credit = what you receive - what you pay

EXAMPLE:
- Stock XYZ is trading at $50
- Sell the $45 put for $0.80
- Buy the $43 put for $0.30
- Net credit = $0.50 ($50 per contract)
- Spread width = $2 ($200 per contract)
- Max loss = $200 - $50 = $150

OUTCOMES:
- Stock stays above $45: Both puts expire worthless, keep $50
- Stock at $44: Short put has value, long put worthless, partial loss
- Stock below $43: Max loss of $150 (long put offsets further losses)

WHEN TO USE:
- Bullish or neutral outlook
- Want defined risk (can't lose more than spread width - credit)
- Works on any priced stock (not limited by capital like CSPs)

CAPITAL REQUIRED:
(Spread width - Credit received) x 100

MAX PROFIT: Net credit received
MAX LOSS: Spread width - Credit
BREAKEVEN: Short strike - Credit per share


================================================================================
CALL CREDIT SPREAD (Bear Call Spread)
================================================================================

WHAT IT IS:
Sell an OTM call and simultaneously buy a further OTM call at a higher strike.
The long call limits your risk.

HOW IT WORKS:
- Sell the lower strike call (receive premium)
- Buy the higher strike call (pay premium)
- Net credit = what you receive - what you pay

EXAMPLE:
- Stock XYZ is trading at $50
- Sell the $55 call for $0.70
- Buy the $57 call for $0.25
- Net credit = $0.45 ($45 per contract)
- Spread width = $2 ($200 per contract)
- Max loss = $200 - $45 = $155

OUTCOMES:
- Stock stays below $55: Both calls expire worthless, keep $45
- Stock at $56: Short call has value, partial loss
- Stock above $57: Max loss of $155 (long call offsets further losses)

WHEN TO USE:
- Bearish or neutral outlook
- Expect the stock to stay flat or go down
- Want defined risk

CAPITAL REQUIRED:
(Spread width - Credit received) x 100

MAX PROFIT: Net credit received
MAX LOSS: Spread width - Credit
BREAKEVEN: Short strike + Credit per share


================================================================================
IRON CONDOR
================================================================================

WHAT IT IS:
Combine a put credit spread AND a call credit spread on the same underlying
with the same expiration. Profits when the stock stays in a range.

HOW IT WORKS:
- Sell OTM put spread (bull put spread)
- Sell OTM call spread (bear call spread)
- Collect premium from both sides

EXAMPLE:
- Stock XYZ is trading at $50
- Sell $45/$43 put spread for $0.50 credit
- Sell $55/$57 call spread for $0.45 credit
- Total credit = $0.95 ($95 per iron condor)
- Max loss = wider spread width - total credit

OUTCOMES:
- Stock stays between $45-$55: Keep full $95
- Stock moves outside range: One side loses, other side wins
- Only one side can lose at expiration

WHEN TO USE:
- Neutral outlook (expect low volatility)
- Stock is range-bound
- IV is elevated (collect more premium)

CAPITAL REQUIRED:
Max loss of the wider spread (only one side at risk)

MAX PROFIT: Total credit from both spreads
MAX LOSS: Wider spread width - Total credit
BREAKEVENS: Lower short strike - credit AND Upper short strike + credit

STRATEGY COMPARISON
================================================================================

                    Capital     Max Loss    Direction   Risk
Strategy            Required    Defined?    Bias        Level
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Cash Secured Put    High        Yes*        Bullish     Medium
Put Credit Spread   Low         Yes         Bullish     Low
Call Credit Spread  Low         Yes         Bearish     Low
Iron Condor         Low         Yes         Neutral     Low

*CSP max loss is strike x 100, which is high but unlikely

CHOOSING A STRATEGY
================================================================================

Use CASH SECURED PUT when:
- You have capital for full collateral
- You'd happily own the stock at that price
- Symbol has lower share price (<$120 for $13k capital)

Use PUT CREDIT SPREAD when:
- Bullish/neutral but want defined risk
- Symbol is too expensive for CSP
- Want to use less capital

Use CALL CREDIT SPREAD when:
- Bearish/neutral outlook
- Stock has run up and you expect consolidation
- Want defined risk on the downside

Use IRON CONDOR when:
- Neutral outlook (expect stock to stay in a range)
- IV is elevated (collect more premium from both sides)
- Want to profit from time decay with defined risk
- Stock is consolidating or range-bound
