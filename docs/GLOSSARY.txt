STRIKE PRICE
  The price at which the option can be exercised.

EXPIRATION DATE
  The date when the option contract expires.

================================================================================
OPTION POSITIONING
================================================================================

ITM (In The Money)
  Call: Stock price > Strike price
  Put: Stock price < Strike price
  Has intrinsic value.

OTM (Out of The Money)
  Call: Stock price < Strike price
  Put: Stock price > Strike price
  No intrinsic value, only time value.

ATM (At The Money)
  Stock price ≈ Strike price

MONEYNESS
  How ITM or OTM an option is.
  Calculated as: Strike / Stock Price
  Moneyness of 0.95 means strike is 5% below current price.


================================================================================
THE GREEKS
================================================================================

DELTA
  How much option price changes per $1 move in stock.
  Call delta: 0 to 1 (positive)
  Put delta: -1 to 0 (negative)
  Also approximates probability of expiring ITM.
  Delta of 0.30 ≈ 30% chance of being ITM at expiration.

GAMMA
  How much delta changes per $1 move in stock.
  Higher near ATM, increases as expiration approaches.
  Risk for short options: gamma can cause rapid delta changes.

THETA
  How much option price decays per day (time decay).
  Positive for sellers: you profit as time passes.
  Accelerates as expiration approaches.
  Measured in $/day per contract.

VEGA
  How much option price changes per 1% change in IV.
  Higher for longer-dated options.
  Sellers benefit when IV decreases (negative vega position).

RHO
  How much option price changes per 1% change in interest rates.
  Usually negligible for short-term options.


================================================================================
VOLATILITY TERMS
================================================================================

IV (Implied Volatility)
  Market's expectation of future volatility.
  Derived from option prices.
  Higher IV = higher option prices.

HV (Historical Volatility)
  Actual past volatility of the stock.
  Calculated from historical price movements.

IV RANK
  Current IV relative to 52-week high and low.
  IV Rank 50% = IV is midway between yearly high and low.

IV PERCENTILE
  Percentage of days when IV was lower than today.
  IV Percentile 80% = IV was lower on 80% of trading days.

TERM STRUCTURE
  How ATM IV varies across different expirations.
  Contango: Near-term IV < Far-term IV (normal)
  Backwardation: Near-term IV > Far-term IV (event expected)

SKEW
  Difference in IV between OTM puts and OTM calls.
  Positive skew: Puts more expensive (fear of downside)
  Negative skew: Calls more expensive (bullish speculation)

25-DELTA SKEW
  Specifically: 25-delta put IV minus 25-delta call IV
  Standard measure of skew in professional trading.

VOLATILITY SURFACE
  3D representation of IV across strikes and expirations.
